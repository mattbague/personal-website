							<strong>Summary:</strong> I began working on this website in my free time during the summer of 2013. Rather than limiting myself
                     to just a paper resume, I thought a having website would be a nice alternative for prospective employers to check out who I am.

							<strong>Summary:</strong> For two quarters, I worked with the same team of 7 in order to implement a computer game version of the
                     fighting card game <a href="http://www.cheapass.com/node/72"> Brawl</a>. For the first quarter,
                     we did requirements analysis and high level design. I was personally in charge creating a UI prototype and presenting it to our team
                     and then the class. For the second quarter, I was system architect and was responsible for maintaining our high level design, confirming
                     our project was being implemented as designed, and handling change requests. I also helped out where needed such as with the SRS and test plan.

							<strong>Summary:</strong> Over the course of a month or so, I worked with two others in order to implement a database management tool for a fictitious hotel. 
                     I set up the initial GUI which consisted of three main layouts based on role: Customer, Business Owner, System Administrator. From there, we each took on one of
                     the previously mentioned parts and implemented it. I was in charge of creating queries for customers and providing them information such as room availability,
                     room rates, and so on.

                     to compress the data. It contains both the ability to compress and decompress from the command line. A maximum
                     dictionary code along with a free list to manage the use of system resources.

							<strong>Summary: </strong> This was the first Android application I made as well as my first major assignment in college. I was
                     paired with a good friend and we both agreed we wanted to make an NES-styled (8 bit) game. It was a small "shoot 'em up" game where the
                     player played as a rubber duck in a bath tub which shot bubbles to destroy enemies. It was well received by our professor and classmates
                     and we even got a bag of candy for how good it was, haha.
