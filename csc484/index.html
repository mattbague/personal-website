<div class="Page" id="main_menu_page">
<h2>Main Menu</h2>

<p>The title screen for our game. When users launch the application, this will be the first screen they see. Users will have the option of starting a new game, loading a previously started game, or altering game settings. Also, a game version is listed in the bottom right hand corner.</p>

<div class="Page" id="newgame_page">
<h2>New Game</h2>

<p>When users select the &quot;New Game&quot; option, they will be brought to this page. All that is required from the user is a name which will be used to identify ownership of save game files. After entering in a name, the user can begin the game immediately by clicking &quot;Begin Game&quot;.</p>

<div class="ImageContainer"><img height="836" src="pages/newgame.png" usemap="#map_newgame" width="944" /></div>

<map name="map_loadgame"></map></div>

<div class="Page" id="deletegame_page">
<h2>Delete Game</h2>

<p>To delete a file, users select which file they want to delete by pressing the desired file. When pressing the file, it does not delete it yet, only highlights it. To follow through with the delete, they must also hit the &quot;Delete&quot; button at the bottom. The font is red to signify caution. If user changes their minds about deleting the file and have not hit the delete button, they can hit the back (&quot;&lt;&lt;&quot;) button at the top.</p>

<div class="Page" id="settings_page">
<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>Users will have the option of adjusting game sound effects (e.g. jump, dash sounds) and in-game background music. By moving the slider all the way to the left, the corresponding sound will be muted.</p>

<div class="Page" id="levelstart_page">
<h2>Level Start</h2>

<p>Basic idea for every level is to navigate through the level until you collect all the memory(ies). The player&#39;s abilities will be required for certain levels and areas in order to reach certain places.</p>

<div class="Page" id="dash_page">
<h2>Dash</h2>

<p>By tapping the dash button (highlighted on the left), the player will be able to quickly horizontally in the direction they are facing. Where the double jump fails, the dash succeeds in being able to get across large gaps.</p>

<h2>Quit</h2>

<h2> Evaluation of Design Choices </h2>

We considered a few different design choices for our navigation and our game play design. 
For our navigation we wanted something that would be familiar to the player. If the
player was not familiar with the navigation we wanted something that would be 
intuitive for them to pick up. For game play, we decided between a vast array of 
platformer game types. We wanted to pick a platformer game design that would be familiar 
to all skill level of players. We wanted to keep the classic feel of a platformer game so
we decided to make the design be 8 bit arcade design. We also wanted to pick a game type 
that would be able to run on the Tizen device without any performance issues. A 
list of our Navigation design and our platformer design choices are below. We 
also evaluate the reasoning behind why choose a given choice. 

<h3> Navigation: </h3>
   <ol>
      <li>Tile layout</li>
         <ul>
            <li>The tile layout is a simple user interface approach; however, 
            it is effective. It presents the options to the user in a clean, 
            concise way. The format fits well on small devices and is a common 
            approach, so it will not alienate any users.</li>
         </ul>
      <li>List View</li>
         <ul>
            <li>Another common and simple approach to a user interface. However,
            as we plan to develop on phones, our resolution (screen real estate) 
            is extremely limited. We worry, depending on the phone, that a list 
            view may be larger than the screen if they hold the phone horizontally.</li>
         </ul>
         
      <li>Swipe</li>
         <ul>
            <li>The swipe method, as seen in applications like SnapChat, is very 
            modern. Essentially, you swipe between main menu screens. This is a 
            very sleek, fun, user interface. It would work well with our game; 
            however, there will be users who have never seen such an interface 
            and may be confused. Also since we decided to make our game run on 
            a web browser this type of navigation would not work well with 
            non touch screen devices.</li>
         </ul>
   </ol>


Our main goal is for this user interface to be fast and intuitive. Therefore, 
we have chosen the Tile layout approach, as it satisfies all of our criteria.

<h3> Platformer types: </h3>
   <ol>
      <li>Single Screen Movement Platformer Game</li>
         <ul>
            <li>Single screen movement is when a player can see the whole
               world at the start of the level. The playing field is static
               which leads to a very simple game play. The benefits of this type
               of platformer game is that it is not as resource intensive. The draw 
               is that it is not as fun to play. We decided that the trade off between
               enjoyment to performance gain is to large to implement this type of
               platformer.</li>
         </ul>
      <li>Scrolling Screen Movement Platformer Game</li>
         <ul>
            <li>Scrolling Movement is when the game screen moves are you explore
               level. This type of platformer game provides a more interesting game 
               play since the player can not see the whole world at once. This
               is also what most people think of today when they hear that a game 
               is a platformer game.</li>
         </ul>
         
      <li>3D Platformer Game</li>
         <ul>
            <li>Today's platformer games are in 3 dimensions. This allows the 
            user to explore their world in any direction that they would like. This 
            type of platformer would have an increase in resources and would have 
            the added problem of the camera angle. We decided that the increase in
            resources would be to much for the Tizen 
            device.</li>
         </ul>
   </ol>

   Overall we wanted to pick a type of platformer game that everyone would enjoy playing.
   We balanced enjoyment that the game would give the user with performance. We wanted
   to keep a classic feel to our platformer game. This is why we decided to implement
   a scrolling screen platformer game.
